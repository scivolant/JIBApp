## GestionSuivi

### A program to follow and manage investments using a SQL database.

Main class: GestionSuivi.java, the program then runs in a window (no output, just modification of the database).

It uses a PostgreSQL database to store data.

### Quickstart

* The JIBApp.jar file enables to run the interface.
* However, to get a fully functional system, you need to create a PostgreSQL database (default name: "jibapp", default user: "postgres"). A minimal database is provided by the files baseDeDonnees.sql and InitialisationBdD.sql (which create and populate the database, respectively). Once in PostgreSQL, type:
```
create database jibapp;
\c jibapp
\i path\to\folder\baseDeDonnees.sql
\i path\to\folder\InitialisationBdD.sql
```
* An overview of basic functions:
   * When connecting to the database, select "jibapp" and use your chosen username.
   * You land on the "Accueil" page (homepage). Select the page (and the
     associated operations) using the combo at the top center of the page.
   * To add a new operation on a given fund, go to the "Opérations et cours" page.
     Select the relevant fund with the "Placement sélectionné" combo (right and slightly below the previous combo).
     You can then create a new transaction with the 'Ajouter une ligne' button
     (bottom left). To create a new order, use the tab 'Ordres'. With the last tab
     'Cours', you can update the value of the investment by providing a Date and a quotation.
   * The "Edition" page enables you to edit the basic properties of objects in the database.

### About the structure

Packages:
* "accueil" - default/initial panel
* "aexecuter" - panel with the alerts on quotations
* "compta" - Java side of objects in the database (Pojo)
* "data" contains the commands for the database (and in particular the subpackage DAO)
* "edition" - edition panel of the program (where new investments can be defined, for instance)
* "observer" for an observer pattern
* "operation" - operation panel, where buying and selling investments are recorded
* "util" - classes used in several different panels.

The git repository contains only the source codes, so the best option to edit it in Eclipse is to clone the repository in .../JIBapp/src/gestion (to avoid any problem with packages...).
